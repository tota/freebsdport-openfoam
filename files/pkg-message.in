OpenFOAM requires environment variable settings contained in files in
%%PREFIX%%/%%REALNAME%%/.%%REALNAME%%-%%VER%%.

a) EITHER, if running bash or ksh (if in doubt type 'echo $SHELL'),
source the .%%REALNAME%%-%%VER%%/bashrc file by adding the following line to
the end of your $HOME/.bashrc file:

. %%PREFIX%%/%%REALNAME%%/.%%REALNAME%%-%%VER%%/bashrc

Then update the environment variables by sourcing the $HOME/.bashrc
file by typing in the terminal:
. $HOME/.bashrc

b) OR, if running tcsh or csh, source the .%%REALNAME%%-%%VER%%/cshrc file by
adding the following line to the end of your $HOME/.cshrc file:

source %%PREFIX%%/%%REALNAME%%/.%%REALNAME%%-%%VER%%/cshrc

Then update the environment variables by sourcing the $HOME/.cshrc
file by typing in the terminal:
source $HOME/.cshrc

If you plan to run FoamX, copy its directories to your $HOME:

mkdir -p $HOME/.%%REALNAME%%-%%VER%%/apps
cp -R %%PREFIX%%/%%REALNAME%%/.%%REALNAME%%-%%VER%%/apps/FoamX	\
$HOME/.%%REALNAME%%-%%VER%%/apps

and set FOAMX_CONFIG to $HOME/.%%REALNAME%%-%%VER%%/apps/FoamX

Then, you could run foamInstallationTest to check your installaton.
See %%PREFIX%%/%%REALNAME%%/README, § 6, to get started.
